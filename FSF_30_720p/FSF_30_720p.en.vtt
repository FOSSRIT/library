00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.870
Software is all around us

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.870
and sometimes inside us.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.480
But what happens

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.730
when the tools we use

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.530
are obeying someone else?

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.690
A tool you control

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.860
serves your interests,

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.310
but if someone else controls it,

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.460
they serve their own.

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.560
When you can examine tools

11
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.890
to see how they work,

12
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.420
you're able to learn about them,

13
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.180
even modify them

14
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.250
to work differently or better.

15
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.310
When you can share a tool

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.590
and its changes,

17
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.200
you help others and, in turn,

18
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.460
they help you.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.850
In fact,

20
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.050
this is how early computing developed.

21
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.010
Everyone could see a program's code

22
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.760
and people shared their work freely

23
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.960
to drive its growth.

24
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.040
Every user was a potential author.

25
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.070
But when companies began

26
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.460
to lock source code away,

27
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.550
it stopped being possible to participate

28
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.290
or even to know what the code was doing.

29
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.020
In response,

30
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.290
hackers formed the GNU project,

31
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.070
to create a computer system

32
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.360
designed to respect

33
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.730
the autonomy of users.

34
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.610
They adopted a copyleft maneuver

35
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.520
and built it into

36
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.590
the GNU General Public License,

37
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.550
a legal structure

38
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630
that preserves user rights.

39
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.270
In ten short years,

40
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.530
the free software movement

41
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.920
had produced the GNU/Linux system.

42
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.420
Computing that nobody could own,

43
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.310
but anyone could use.

44
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.660
Today it's keeping planes in the air,

45
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.920
stocks trading

46
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170
and the global Internet running.

47
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.120
We all encounter free software

48
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.760
in invisible ways.

49
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.170
But software freedom

50
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870
was designed for people.

51
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.290
It's about what shape

52
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.860
the technology we inhabit

53
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.880
will take,

54
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.160
and what kind of society

55
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.620
we use our digital powers to build.

56
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.630
We've still got work to do.

57
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.850
